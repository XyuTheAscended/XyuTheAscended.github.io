        <h1>Videogames are awesome!</h1>
        <h2>Things you should know about videogames</h2>
        <p>I can assume that you already know what a videogame is, but what you do not know is that it actually has benefits? Well there are many benefits that you may not even know of. One of the benefits according to <a href="https://www.iberdrola.com/talent/benefits-video-games-learning">Iberdrola.com</a> videogames are known to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Speeds up response times</li>
            <li>Encourages teamwork</li>
            <li>Stimulate creativity, focus, and visual memory</li>
            <li>Teach languages</li>
            <li>Help with critical thinking skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are just some of many benefits from gaming! I think if you were to give it a try you may realize how it may affect your thinking. Speaking of changing the way you think I'm going to show you two images of videogames and based off the image of them what would be your opinion on them?</p>
